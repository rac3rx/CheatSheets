TCPDUMP & Save Capture to Remote Server w/ GZIP

NOTE: When opening the files you might need to strip the very top line with notepad++ as its a mistake header

This is useful when the local machine where you need to do the packet capture with tcpdump doesn?t have enough room to save the file, where as your remote host does

tcpdump -i eth0 -w - | ssh forge.remotehost.com -c arcfour,blowfish-cbc -C -p 50005 "cat - | gzip > /tmp/eth0.pcap.gz"

Your @ PC1 doing a tcpdump of PC1s eth0 interface and its going to save the output @ PC2 who is called save.location.com to a file /tmp/eth0-to-me.pcap.gz again on PC2

This is a better way to do the "src X or dst X" filter; plus you might not want to bother with DNS lookups (-n).

see what traffic is mostly hitting you

Sometimes it is useful to have just a general picture of "what is taking all the bandwidth here". Running this command will limit tcpdump to a few packets (instead of flooding your terminal endlessly) and will provide a small, but sometimes sufficient, sample to determine what is going on.

Useful to quickly diagnose DOS attacks.
