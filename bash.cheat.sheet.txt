How To Initiate a Loop
Although the while loop remains the easiest method for reading a file line by line, it does have its side effects. The while loop will obliterate the formatting of lines, including spaces and tabs. Furthermore, the for loop coupled with a change of IFS helps keep the structure of the document output.

Syntax

old_IFS=$IFS      # save the field separator               # while loop con: delete formatting of lines, spaces, & tabs    
IFS=$'\n'     # new field separator, the end of line       # backup and change IFS to keep structure of document outpus    
for line in $(cat fichier)          
do          
   command          
done          
IFS=$old_IFS     # restore default field separator         # restore IFS
