As Jiri mentioned, you can use scp -r user@host:/some/remote/path /some/local/path to copy files recursively. This assumes that there's a single directory containing all of the files you want to transfer (and nothing else).

However, SFTP provides an alternative if you want to transfer files from multiple different directories, and the destinations are not identical:

sftp user@host << EOF
  get /some/remote/path1/file1 /some/local/path1/file1
  get /some/remote/path2/file2 /some/local/path2/file2
  get /some/remote/path3/file3 /some/local/path3/file3
EOF

This uses the "here doc" syntax to define a sequence of SFTP input commands. As an alternative, you could put the SFTP commands into a text file and execute sftp user@host -b batchFile.txt

The simplest way is

local$ scp remote:{A/1,A/2,B/3,C/4}.txt ./

So {.. } list can include directories (A,B and C here are directories; "1.txt" and "2.txt" are file names in those directories).

Although it would copy all these four files into one local directory - not sure if that's what you wanted.

In the above case you will end up remote files A/1.txt, A/2.txt, B/3.txt and C/4.txt copied over to a single local directory, with file names ./1.txt, ./2.txt, ./3.txt and ./4.txt

Wouldn't this overwrite the content of A/1.txt with the content of B/1.txt on the local machine? – Yves Dorfsman Jun 7 '16 at 4:03
   	 
	
good point.. adjusted example (so now it wouldn't overwrite) and added description. Thanks. – Ruslan Jun 7 '16 at 15:46
   	 
	
Brace expansions like this are a Bash feature, and not portable to e.g. POSIX sh. – tripleee Jul 31 '16 at 9:41
   	 
	
@tripleee, thanks. it might not be posix, but it works not only in bash. I use ksh all the time and it works there too. – Ruslan Jul 31 '16 at 18:36

You can also mix dirs and files by doing: local$ scp -r remote:{A/1.txt,A/2.txt,B/3.txt,C/4.txt,D,F} ./ – donhector Oct 19 '16 at 6:40
