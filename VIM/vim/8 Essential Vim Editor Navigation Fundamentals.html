This article is part of the ongoing Vi / Vim Tips and Tricks
<http://www.thegeekstuff.com/tag/vi-vim-tips-and-tricks/> series.
Navigation is a vital part of text editing. To be very productive, you
should be aware of all possible navigation shortcuts in your editor. In
this article, let us review the following 8 Vi / Vim navigation options.

 1. Line navigation
 2. Screen navigation
 3. Word navigation
 4. Special navigation
 5. Paragraph navigation
 6. Search navigation
 7. Code navigation
 8. Navigation from command line


      1. Vim Line Navigation

Following are the four navigation that can be done line by line.

  * k – navigate upwards
  * j – navigate downwards
  * l – navigate right side
  * h – navigate left side

||
By using the repeat factor in VIM we can do this operation for N times.
For example, when you want to
go down by 10 lines, then type “10j”.
||
Within a line if you want to navigate to different position, you have 4
other options.

  * 0 – go to the starting of the current line.
  * ^ – go to the first non blank character of the line.
  * $ – go to the end of the current line.
  * g_ – go to the last non blank character of the line.


      2. Vim Screen Navigation

Following are the three navigation which can be done in relation to text
shown in the screen.

  * H – Go to the first line of current screen.
  * M – Go to the middle line of current screen.
  * L – Go to the last line of current screen.
  * ctrl+f – Jump forward one full screen.
  * ctrl+b – Jump backwards one full screen
  * ctrl+d – Jump forward (down) a half screen
  * ctrl+u – Jump back (up) one half screen


      3. Vim Special Navigation

You may want to do some special navigation inside a file, which are:

  * N% – Go to the Nth percentage line of the file.
  * NG – Go to the Nth line of the file.
  * G – Go to the end of the file.
  * `” – Go to the position where you were in NORMAL MODE while last
    closing the file.
  * `^ – Go to the position where you were in INSERT MODE while last
    closing the file.
  * g – Go to the beginning of the file.


      4. Vim Word Navigation

You may want to do several navigation in relation to the words, such as:

  * e – go to the end of the current word.
  * E – go to the end of the current WORD.
  * b – go to the previous (before) word.
  * B – go to the previous (before) WORD.
  * w – go to the next word.
  * W – go to the next WORD.

||
WORD – WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated
with white space.
word – word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores.
||
Example to show the difference between WORD and word

  * 192.168.1.1 – single WORD
  * 192.168.1.1 – seven words.


      5. Vim Paragraph Navigation

  * *{* – Go to the beginning of the current paragraph. By pressing {
    again and again move to the previous paragraph beginnings.
  * *}* – Go to the end of the current paragraph. By pressing } again
    and again move to the next paragraph end, and again.


      6. Vim Search Navigation

  * */i* – Search for a pattern which will you take you to the next
    occurrence of it.
  * *?i* – Search for a pattern which will you take you to the previous
    occurrence of it.
  * ** *– Go to the next occurrence of the current word under the cursor.
  * *# *– Go to the previous occurrence of the current word under the
    cursor.


      7. Vim Code Navigation

*%* – Go to the matching braces, or parenthesis inside code.


      8. Vim Navigation from Command Line

Vim +N filename: Go to the Nth line of the file after opening it.

vim +10 /etc/passwd

||
Vim +/pattern filename: Go to the particular pattern’s line inside the
file, first occurrence from first. In the following example, it will
open the README file and jump to the first occurrence of the word “install”.

vim +/install README

||
Vim +?patten filename: Go to the particular pattern’s line inside the
file, first occurrence from last. In the following example, it will open
the README file and jump to the last occurrence of the word “bug”.

vim +?bug README

||

    Navigation using marks is very important without it vim is as good
    or bad as Emacs. A mark can be put using the letter m followed by
    any other latter. A small letter used for a mark is scoped within
    the file, while a capital letter used for a mark is scoped across
    files. To jump to a mark use `a or ‘a, I prefer the `a since it
    takes me to the exact position where I left the mark. To look at
    where the marks are use :marks in the ed mode.

    overall steps for mark navigation are;
    Put mark on a line using ma go to some other place edit and then
    jump back using `a
    Say I am in some file I put a mark using mA go to some other file in
    same buffer and then jump back using `A, this is really cool I get
    to jump back to previous file with just 2 keystrokes.

    Finally, ctags are also very important for code navigation without
    ctags vim is as bad as Eclipse, use Ctrl-] to jump to a function
    definition and Ctrl-t to comeback from the tag stack.

    Cheers,

    Okay.. I’ve been using vim for a while and I thought I knew most of
    the goofy little shortcuts.

    very cool. Screen shortcuts I wasn’t aware of and some of the
    special navigation shortcuts are new. Thanks for the post.

    Thanks for your comment, and also for the short introduction about
    the MARKS, for which we have a detailed article at How To Add
    Bookmarks Inside Vi and Vim Editor

    suggested to the article.

    Under code navigation, you mention the good old % key for matching
    braces and parentheses. You get a whole world of extra functionality
    by enabling the matchit plugin and filetype plugins. In brief:

    :runtime macros/matchit.vim
    :filetype plugin on

    Now, open an HTML file (for example), put the cursor on a tag
    (inside, not on, the angle brackets) and hit % to jump to the
    closing tag. For details,

    :help matchit-install
    :help :filetype-plugin-on

    Hi Ramesh,
    Thanks for all your work of this site, and thanks for this topic.

    BTW, “bellszhu” seems to be right,
    [Go to the beginning of the file] is either:
    gg
    1G
    1gg

    but not a simple g

    g; = go the previous change you made.
    g, = go to the next change you made (after going backwards, vim
    can’t tell the future just yet).

    honestly life altering key bindings.

    CTRL+O and CTRL+I are similar but they send you back and forth
    between jumps vs changes.

    More:
    :h changelist
    :h jumplist
