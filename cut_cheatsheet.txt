Cheat Sheet: Cutting Text with cut

None

   Written by Benjamin Cane on 2012/10/22

   [INS: :INS]

   The cut command is a Unix/Linux tool used to literally cut text from files and output from
   other commands. With the cut command a user can take text and output only certain parts of
   the line.

   In my opinion cut is the most under recognized and utilized command in Linux/Unix. This is
   mostly due to the fact that when most Sysadmins want to cut text from files or standard
   output many will reach for AWK.

   While AWK is a great tool for quick and dirty commands; I tend to reach for cut before AWK.
   The below cheat sheet should show many ways to use cut with every day tasks.

Common Separated Values

Print the first field out of a CSV file

 $ cut -d: -f1 passwd.bak
   root
   daemon

Print the first field out of CSV output from another command

 $ head -1 /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
   root

Print the first, second, and seventh field out of a CSV file

   To change the field simply change the numbers after -f separated by a comma.
 $ cut -d: -f1,2,7 passwd.bak
  root:x:/bin/bash

Print text based on Spaces

 $ cut -d  -f3 /etc/motd
  Ubuntu

Print the fourth field and everything after that from a command

   This command is pretty handy if you wanted to make a script out of the past few commands
   you ran.
 $ history | cut -d  -f 4-
  ping google.com

Print up to the 4th field

 $ cut -d  -f-4 /etc/motd
  Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04

Print all fields between 5 and 8

 $ cut -d: -f5-8 passwd
  root:/root:/bin/bash

Output with a different delimiter (make a CSV)

Convert : to ,

 $ cut --output-delimiter=, -d: -f1- passwd
  root,x,0,0,root,/root,/bin/bash

Convert space to ,

 $ ps -elf | cut --output-delimiter=, -d -f1-
 F,S,UID,,,,,,,,PID,,PPID,,C,PRI,,NI,ADDR,SZ,WCHAN,,STIME,TTY,,,,,,,,,,TIME,CMD
 4,S,root,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,0,,0,,80,,,0,-,,6083,poll_s,19:07,?,,,,,,,,00:00:12,/sbin/init

Output only lines that have a delimiter

   This command will only output lines that have a : (in our example), within the file tmpfile
   there are multiple lines some with : and some without.
 $ head tmpfile
 Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-29-generic x86_64)

 root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
 daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
 bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh
 sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh
 sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

 $ cut -s -d: -f1-4 tmpfile
 root:x:0:0
 daemon:x:1:1
 bin:x:2:2
 sys:x:3:3
 sync:x:4:65534

Bytes

Print bytes 1 through 45

 $ cut -b1-45 /etc/motd
 Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-

Print everything but bytes 10 through 45

 $ cut --complement -b10-45 /etc/motd
 Welcome t29-generic x86_64)

Characters

Print characters 1 through 25

 $ cut -c1-25 /etc/motd
 Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 L
